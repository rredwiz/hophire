This is a project that allows users to search for tech-related jobs. It's currently just a frontend, but will be expanded and continued.

### Expected features to come:
* Job search utilities.
* User authentication with personal statistics.
* Live application tracker and progress viewer.

# Current Progress

Currently I have some simple static ui. The empty cards will be filled with job-related information.
